<h1>TODO</h1> <br>
<ul>
  <li>i count about 245 lyrics or "bars" for 2 songs so about 122.5 bars per song. Assuming a robust model, i would need 50000 per class. so i have 2 classes, 1 = profane, 0 = not profane. so all in all 100,000 bars. if my math is right need about 816 songs. i will train it on 1000 songs just to be safe</li>
    <li> set up a script that automates the labelling process for 1000 songs.</li>
      <li>1000 songs seems too much to handle but eminem himself has about 11 albumns in his discography. assuming an average of 15 songs per album, 1 artist gives me upwards of 150 songs. so i just need 10 artists, maybe</li>
