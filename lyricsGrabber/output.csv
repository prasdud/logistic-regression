Verse 1
Yeah I guess I am a disappointment doing everything I can
I do not want to make you disappointed it is annoying
I just want to make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place right Yeah Ima just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin at the ground I am embarrassed for you
Paranoia what did I do wrong this time
that is parents for you
Very loyal Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it´ my hands are full
What else should I carry for you
I cared for you but

Verse 2
Yeah you do not want to make this work
You just want to make this worse
Want me to listen to you but you do not ever hear my words
You do not want to know my hurt yeah
Let me guess you want an apology probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this
We cannot so I guess Ima have to leave
Please do not come after me
I just want to be alone right now I do not really want to think at all
Go ahead just drink it off
Both know you are going to call tomorrow like nothings wrong
is not that what you always do
I feel like every time I talk to you you are in an awful mood
What else can I offer you
there is nothing left right now I gave it all to you

Verse 3
Yeah do not talk down to me
that is not going to work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I do not even want to go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me eventually I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I am a letdown
But it is cool I checked out
Oh you want to be friends now
Okay let us put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that did not even happen
I mean why are you laughing
Must have missed that joke let me see if I can find a reaction
No but at least you are happy
Chorus
Feels like we are on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I am proud

All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I am sorry that I let you down
Oh let you down

Verse 1 Lil Wayne
Ahem
Excuse my charisma vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan start Weezy because the F is for finisher
So misunderstood but what is a world without enigma
Two bitches at the same time synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted because she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin family picture
You know Father Time and we all know Mother Nature
it is all in the family but I am of no relation
No matter who is buyin I am a celebration
Black and white diamonds fuck segregation
Fuck that shit my money up you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin shit and you niggas just runnerups
I do not feel I done enough so Ima keep on doing this shit

Okay
I lost my mind it is somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you do not understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon be hoes so I could not blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up call it selfdefense
Swear man I be seein through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they HeMen pow pow the end
Talkin to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money fuck the world that is adultery
You full of shit you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
Young Money eatin all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin bitch I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these mafuckers talkin crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty half full I will spill ya
Try me and run into a wall outfielder
You know Ima ball til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor I enjoy em while they still ripe
Bitch stop playin I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals then Ima have a mink soon
Tell em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth but I guess that is a foreign language to you all
And I call it like I see it and my glasses on
But most of you all do not get the picture less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing you do not know the half of it
Young Money Cash Money uh
Paper chasin tell that paper Look I am right behind ya
Bitch real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I am borderline crazy sorta kind of
Woman of my dreams I do not sleep so I cannot find her
You niggas are gelatin peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin well now wish me well
Tell em kiss my ass call it kiss and tell
Verse 3 Cory Gunz
Yeah word to my mama I am out of my lima bean
do not want to see what that drama mean get some Dramamine
Llama scream hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits bitch Wayne signed a fiend
II play the side for you niggas that is tryna front and see
Son of Gun Son of Sam you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech I glow like Buddha
Disturb me and you will be all over the flo like Luda
Bitch I flow like scuba bitch I am bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho she gon blow right through ya
I be mackin bout my stackin amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold bitch but our actions is cooler Wayne
These niggas out they mind I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind tuck these I fuck these on your mind pause
To feed them on my grind did I get a little love keep throwin my sign
In the middle hit em up piece on my side ‘because is not no peace on my side
Bitch I am a man I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to I am shootin when the funeral outside
I am uptown thoroughbred a BX nigga
Ya heard Gunna181Embed
