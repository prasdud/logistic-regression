"Before I get banned, kicked off Twitter"
"And TikTok 'because they so damn ticked off, bitter"
They want me to bounce (Like what?) like a fabric softener
"We just got rid of Ye, go kick rocks with him (Ayy)"
But Dre on beats with the white-faced blondie on the mic
Is like (What?) havin' Steady B and Cool C in the ride
Like we rap and did a little bank robbery on the side
"So they want beef, we can make like Bonnie and collide"
"Haters can meet the same exact fate as my dad, wait"
"Least he did not miss me graduate (Okay, yeah, great)"

So it is breakfast in bed if I wake up next to a dead body (Ah)
"Multiple lacerations, contusions, abrasions, bruises"
"Hallucinations, delusions, abusive, my language usage"
"They lose it when Dre produced it, as soon as he plays the music"
"it is lunacy, treat the beat like a choice, Shady chews it"
"Now all I see is dollar signs, losers"
"Bitch, I was in them trenches like them Columbine shooters"

Just opened the biggest can of worms on the whole planet Earth

"But, Marshall"
you are gettin' more perverse every time you record a verse and
"it is like you came from 2000, stepped out a portal, cursin'"
Hurlin' horrible slurs towards the world and
Why cannot you make fun of people behind their backs like a normal person?
"But when you reach these heights, freedom of speech dies (What?)"
"With every line that I recite, them PC police try"
To throw me in jail with no bail like a peace prize
