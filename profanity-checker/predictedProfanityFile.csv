Lyrics,Profanity Label
[Intro: J. Cole & Damian Lillard],[0]
It is not nothing I want more,[0]
is not nothing I want more,[0]
I is not câ€“,[0]
"I told you, when I first came here, I said, ""I is not come here to waste my time""",[0]
I came here,[0]
"They gave us a chance to get in, like we asked for",[0]
"And that is, that is what we here to do",[0]
"Yeah, nigga, 2-6",[1]
The job still is not done,[0]
Straight up,[0]
"But I, I said, ""You, you know what I am here for""",[0]

[Verse: J. Cole],[0]
"Back on top, punchin' the clock, clutchin' sanity",[0]
I got more cribs than Habitat for Humanity,[0]
"Shit profound, we propagating more profanity",[1]
"Paid off collections from recollections of calamity (Oh shit, look, that nigga 'bout to shoot)",[1]
"The shit pop off, I learned to duck under the canopy (Oh shit, run, nigga, run)",[1]
"'Til it cool off, they murked a nigga right in front of me",[1]
Told him to come off his chain for tryna floss,[0]
Died over a cross just like the start of Christianity,[1]
"When I was a boy, the teacher often reprimanded me (Jermaine)",[0]
"Thought it was toys, it was a Glock this nigga handed me",[1]
"I busted the trees, was barely strong enough to squeeze",[0]
"Bullets traveled through leaves, it probably killed somebody randomly",[1]
Ran in the crib and played it off amongst the family,[0]
"Nightmare scenes, the police finally apprehended me",[0]
"Woke up screamin', seen a demon had his hand on me",[1]
Still sport the scar on my arm from where he branded me,[0]
"Like a Que Dog, my niggas burnin' with the mute off",[1]
"Loud pack smoke through the cracks, I catch a contact",[0]
"Triggerin' a paranoid mindset, now I am back",[0]
Teeterin' between enlightened and insanity,[0]
"Now that I am rich, I feel nobody understandin' me",[0]
"All I can do is cut the mic on, holler at you",[0]
cannot let the fame scare me off from speaking candidly,[0]
"All them niggas that sold 'caine, they started singin' like Danity",[1]
"Now I am left here, paid like I planned to be, damn",[1]

[Outro: Damian Lillard],[0]
"A lotta times, those situations are, um, are handled way before the time comes",[0]
"In the summer, I think when you truly prepare yourself, and",[0]
"With training and conditioning, and things like that",[0]
"When you cheat yourself, you fail in those moments",[0]
"You know, you crash, and when you really put the time in and",[0]
"Whether people see it, or whether people know it or not",[0]
"You know, it always come to light",[0]
