[Intro: J. Cole & Damian Lillard]
It is not nothing I want more
is not nothing I want more
I is not câ€“
"I told you, when I first came here, I said, ""I is not come here to waste my time"""
I came here
"They gave us a chance to get in, like we asked for"
"And that is, that is what we here to do"
"Yeah, nigga, 2-6"
The job still is not done
Straight up
"But I, I said, ""You, you know what I am here for"""

[Verse: J. Cole]
"Back on top, punchin' the clock, clutchin' sanity"
I got more cribs than Habitat for Humanity
"Shit profound, we propagating more profanity"
"Paid off collections from recollections of calamity (Oh shit, look, that nigga 'bout to shoot)"
"The shit pop off, I learned to duck under the canopy (Oh shit, run, nigga, run)"
"'Til it cool off, they murked a nigga right in front of me"
Told him to come off his chain for tryna floss
Died over a cross just like the start of Christianity
"When I was a boy, the teacher often reprimanded me (Jermaine)"
"Thought it was toys, it was a Glock this nigga handed me"
"I busted the trees, was barely strong enough to squeeze"
"Bullets traveled through leaves, it probably killed somebody randomly"
Ran in the crib and played it off amongst the family
"Nightmare scenes, the police finally apprehended me"
"Woke up screamin', seen a demon had his hand on me"
Still sport the scar on my arm from where he branded me
"Like a Que Dog, my niggas burnin' with the mute off"
"Loud pack smoke through the cracks, I catch a contact"
"Triggerin' a paranoid mindset, now I am back"
Teeterin' between enlightened and insanity
"Now that I am rich, I feel nobody understandin' me"
"All I can do is cut the mic on, holler at you"
cannot let the fame scare me off from speaking candidly
"All them niggas that sold 'caine, they started singin' like Danity"
"Now I am left here, paid like I planned to be, damn"

[Outro: Damian Lillard]
"A lotta times, those situations are, um, are handled way before the time comes"
"In the summer, I think when you truly prepare yourself, and"
"With training and conditioning, and things like that"
"When you cheat yourself, you fail in those moments"
"You know, you crash, and when you really put the time in and"
"Whether people see it, or whether people know it or not"
"You know, it always come to light"
