[Verse 1: Eminem]
"Gen Z, here they come now (Now)"
'Bout to unload rounds (Brrt)
Pronouns (Shit)
"Got me like, ""Woah now"" (Woah)"
"Homie, let us slow down (Chill)"
No need to get so wound (Man)
Ready to throw down (Yo)
"If I mispronounce (Thee, them)"
"Whoops (Sorry), oh wow"
"Got heterosexuals crammin' them down our throats now (He, she, they, them)"
Like I am gettin' snow-plowed
My humor's too low-brow (Yup)
"Yeah, so there is no doubt (Nope)"
You 'bout to get grossed out (Ugh)
"But fuck it though, somebody needs to come and hit the reset button"
Back to 2003 because how did we get stuck in
"This woke BS? I am tryna make it regress, fuck them"
"And I do not regret nothing that is 'bout to be said, so fuck it, we can keep headbuttin'"
"Still a grade-A prick, but the same way (What?)"
"Cobain put the gauge to his brain, I am going out with a bang, ayy (Yeah)"
"Dang, Dre"
"Look what you made me do, maybe you the one they should blame, they"
Say they wish that I was not so angry (Yeah)
"Do not want to see me going off the deep end like Ye, ayy (No, nah)"
"Rather see me do like Kim Kardashian, they say (Yeah)"
"Yeah, and find a way to get rid of all of this rage, ayy (Haha)"
"But if you wonder, ""Why is Marsh considered the harshest spitter?"" (Why?)"
Because I can spit a bar like it is a
"Cross between Nas and GZA, Biggie Smalls, and RZA"
"So hard, Megan Thee Stallion and Nicki Minaj'll scissor (Cut it out)"
You are still the press's wet dream (Yeah)
Too many head shrinks (Oh)
"My head thinks foul, I have said things when jesting"
They should arrest me for my testes (Ah)
"The biggest in the South, West, East, North and catch be (Ah)"
Evidence swept clean
With extreme lengths and steps being took to suppress things (Why?)
Try not to get seen
"With Ben Affleck, me, and Seth Green hangin' on to the left wing"
"Of Jeffrey Epstein's jet screamin', ""Hey, do not forget me"" (Haha)"
"Shady as Bill, takin' the pill and putting it in your soft drink (Ah)"
Something is off and I do not know what the because be (Yeah)
"But it is obvi', this water I am in is scalding"
Ominous thoughts creep in my head and it is not me
"They brainwashed me (Marshall, Marshall)"
"And that is all she wrote, yeah, that is why they call me"

"Marshall, he is the Antichrist"

"Hey, why you cryin', shorty? Ew, because I boo'd you (Woah)"
"Well, bitch, I am tryna get some head up in this Subaru"
"But you have no clue what you doing, do you?"
"You fall asleep or something? Hello, yoo-hoo"
"Wake up, fake slut, I am out of here, screw you"
"What, did you drop dead in my lap? You call that head?"
"I suck my dick better than you do, haha"
"Yeah, I am sick like the terminally ill (What?)"
"But more like sick as in the term ""mentally ill"""

"Look who is talkin', dog, like Brian from Family Guy (Huh)"

"Ghastly, and insidious as me, or spitting as nasty?"
Next idiot ask me is getting his ass beat worse than Diddy did ****

"Because they steady haunt me (Yeah, oh)"
"Shady's bad to the core, but look at the bread he got me (Bread)"
"Complete lack of remorse, so they have come at me before, but they will not ever stop me"
But fuck the back and the forth until I am dead and rotting
Head is probably whacked and it is warped like Jack Kevork'
Performin' sexual acts with a corpse

"I do not appeal to you, you was one of them children whose (What?)"
Parents fed every meal to you on a platter and silver spoon
I am a product of what Farina and powdered milk'll do (What?)
To your drive when them rappers like Jada bring out the will in you (Woo)
"Because now my shit slaps harder than Will'll do, word to Gorilla Glue (Why?)"
I do not need sticky fingers to steal on you (Nah)
"Lyrical killer who punish you, every syllable sonnin' you (Yeah)"
"Your hides, I tanned them like bicycles built for two"
"Stickin' a clip in the Uz' that I have been itchin' to use, lookin' like Nikolas Cruz"
"My trigger's happy, it is ticklish, true, Travis Bickle them too, we gettin' rude"
"This shit'll go sideways like you are tippin' a canoe, bitch, I am sick as the flu (Bitch)"
"How the fuck are you going to fit in my shoes? Look at my views, all the shit I have been through"
"So, sympathy, I do not have any for you, stickin' it to all you idiots who"
"Take my lyrics a little bit too literal, you can all suck on my dick and if you"
"Do not want to get ripped, better get the fuck back, bitch, I am here to do what Dre sent me to do (What?)"
