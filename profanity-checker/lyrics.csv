"Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes"
What does not kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
"And it is new, the shape of your body"
"It is blue, the feeling I have got"
"And it is ooh, woah-oh"
It is a cruel summer

It is a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I am drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
"Said, ""I am fine,"" but it was not true"
I do not want to keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate

"And I scream, ""For whatever it is worth"
"I love you, are not that the worst thing you ever heard?"""
"He looks up, grinnin' like a devil"
