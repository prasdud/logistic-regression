[Verse 1]
"I murder a rhyme, one word at a time"
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
"You better get rid of that 9, it is not going to help"
What good's it going to do against a man that strangles himself?
"I am waitin' for Hell, like Hell, shit, I am anxious as Hell"
"Manson, you are safe in that cell, be thankful it is jail"
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
"Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf"
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
"(Hey Ma', Ma'!)"
"I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less"
"What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press"
"I am stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset"
"it is just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)"
"Grew up quick (No), was raised right"
"Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right"
"You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi"""
Became a commodity 'because I am W-H-I-
"T-E, 'because MTV was so friendly to me"
cannot wait 'til Kim sees me
"Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?"
"Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth is not workin'?"
"You hear this finger? Oh, it is upside down"
"Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now"

[Verse 2]
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
"Just to see if he is influenced by me, if he listens to music"
"And if he feeds into this shit, he is an innocent victim"
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
(*Scratches*) My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio did not play me
"The sensational (*scratch*), ""Back is the incredible!"""
"With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible"
it is Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed (Uh)
it is a sick world we live in these days
"""Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"" (""Oh, oh, oh, oh!"")"
"Geez, you guys are so sensitive"
"""Slim, it is a touchy subject, try and just do not mention it"""
"Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic whose eyes get so squinted"
I am blind from smoke in 'em with my windows tinted
"With nine limos rented, doing' lines of coke in 'em"
"With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented"
And that is where I get my name from
that is why they call me—

[Chorus]
They call me Slim Shady (I am back)

that is why they call me Slim Shady (I am back)
"I am back (I am back), I am back (Slim Shady!)"
that is why they call me Slim Shady (I am back)

[Verse 3]
"I take seven {kids} from {Columbine}, stand 'em all in line"
"Add an AK-47, a revolver, a .9"
A MAC-11 and it ought to solve the problem of mine
And that is a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time (Ahh-! Ahh-ahh-!)
"'because I am Shady, they call me as crazy"
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
"And by the way, NSYNC, why do they sing?"
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what you all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
it is why I tend to block out when I hear things
'because all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ahh!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
'because if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
"it would be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy, you know this"
"I am sorry, Puff, but I do not give a fuck"
"If this chick was my own mother, I would still fuck her with no rubber"
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
At the same time and just say that it is not mine—what is my name?

They call me Slim Shady (I am back)

[Outro]
"Guess who is b-back, back"
"Gue-gue-guess who is back (Hi, Mom!)"
{​​*scratch*}​​ Guess who is back

I am blew out from this blunt (*sighs*) fuck
